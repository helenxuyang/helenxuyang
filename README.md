### Hello!
Current projects:
- exercise-generator: a Flutter app for generating workouts for people like me who hate exercising
- stomach-tracker: a Flutter app for logging what goes in and out of your stomach to help with identifying food intolerances
- personal website: the first step in my long journey of learning about web dev :)
