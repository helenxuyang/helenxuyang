# About
Hello! My name is Helen. I graduated from Cornell University in 2023 and am now a frontend software developer with an interest in web/app development and accessibility. I primarily have experience with React and Flutter.

# Projects
I'm currently working on some random side projects such as:
* scioly_event_matcher: Tool for assigning event supervisors for Science Olympiad at Cornell
* various apps for me to 1. use in my everyday life and 2. learn about modern Android development ðŸ˜„
