### Hello!
My name is Helen and I'm a CS student interested in app/web development and accessibility. I'm most familiar with Flutter and React, but am hoping to learn about other platforms and frameworks. I'm currently (June-Dec 2021) taking a software engineering co-op with the accessibility team at Curriculum Associates!

Currently working on:
- [carriage-rider](https://github.com/cornell-dti/carriage-driver), [carriage-driver](https://github.com/cornell-dti/carriage-driver), and [carriage-web](https://github.com/cornell-dti/carriage-web) for [Cornell DTI](https://www.cornelldti.org/)
- [my portfolio site](https://github.com/helenxuyang/helenxuyang.github.io) made with React 
- random personal projects here and there like [Zoom University](https://github.com/helenxuyang/zoom-university), a site for keeping track of Zoom class links that will be repurposed as a school planner now that we're finally done with Zoom classes, and [Minesweeper](https://github.com/helenxuyang/minesweeper) just for fun
